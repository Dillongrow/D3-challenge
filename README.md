# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

The data set included within this is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using different D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements:

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated my axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Placed additional labels in my scatter plot and gave them click events so that my users can decide which data to display. Animated the transitions for my circles' locations as well as the range of my axes.
